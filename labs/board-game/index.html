    <h2>Part 1 - Class Construction</h2>
    <p>The game I chose for this assignment is Checkers. In the game Checkers, two players use two different sets of
        colored game pieces on a
        64 grid board and attempt to eliminate the other player. The data needed for this game are the position of
        pieces on the board, player
        movement, total pieces left on the board, and a way to check which pieces have been eliminated. The main classes
        in this game are the
        red and black checker pieces and the board itself. The board keeps track of where each piece can move and how
        many pieces are currently
        on the board. The checkers share most of the same properites except that they are against each other. If one
        players piece hops over another then
        the opposing player loses their piece. Also, if the player reaches the opposing side of the board, they are able
        to "king" there piece, giving
        them an extra piece atop of the current one.
